Lease/Buy vehicles on Blockchain

### Introduction
Vehicle history related frauds such as modified vehicle odometers, wrong vehicle history (ownership, accidents, flood damage, repairs, recalls, airbag deployment, service records etc.) are very common in used vehicle and lease market.

To solve this problem of trust - We propose to leverage a decentralized and publicly accessible vehicle Blockchain to build a vehicle marketplace for leasing vehicles - since all the data in the blockchain vehicle registry cannot be changed, faked, rewritten or manipulated.

### Tech Stack
IBM blockchain platform (hyperledger) and AngularJS web portal running on Ubuntu.
